# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-System-using-LLMs
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and IMDb data to build a personalized movie recommendation system, capable of understanding nuanced user preferences for enhanced content suggestions.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses advanced LLMs for accurate, user-centered movie suggestions.
- **Robust NLP and Vectorization**: Processes user queries with NLP techniques, transforming them into vectors for precise matching.
- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: Calculates similarity between user queries and movie data for relevant recommendations.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: IMDb dataset consolidation.
2. **NLP Preprocessing**: Tokenization and encoding user query features.
3. **Vectorization**: Embedding movie descriptions for semantic matching.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Cosine similarity to align user preferences with movies.
