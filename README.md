# Personalized-Recommendation-System-using-LLMs
This repository serves as a comprehensive toolkit for leveraging IMDB datasets to develop sophisticated recommendation systems. It embodies a complete workflow, beginning with the meticulous generation of custom datasets and extending through the intricate preprocessing stages necessary for effective recommendation model implementation.


## Overview
The project kickstarts with the aggregation and cleansing of IMDB datasets, focusing on titles, ratings, and episode information to craft a refined dataset optimized for recommendation purposes. This foundational dataset undergoes a series of preprocessing steps, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stop words removal, and lemmatization, preparing it for advanced analytical applications.

Key Features
Custom Dataset Creation: Utilizes IMDB's diverse datasets to create a tailored dataset, focusing on the data most relevant for recommendations, including metadata and ratings.

Advanced Preprocessing: Implements a range of NLP techniques to transform raw data into a format ready for analysis, ensuring the dataset is optimized for recommendation algorithms.

Toolkit for Recommendation Systems: Provides a solid base for developing recommendation systems, with methodologies outlined for both dataset preparation and data preprocessing.


## Project Significance
By integrating dataset generation with preprocessing, this toolkit streamlines the process of developing recommendation systems, addressing the challenges of handling large, unstructured datasets. It is designed for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts aiming to explore recommendation algorithms or anyone interested in the application of NLP techniques in dataset preparation.

The notebooks within this repository not only guide the user through the technical aspects of dataset manipulation and preparation but also shed light on the conceptual underpinnings, making it a valuable resource for both educational and practical purposes in the realm of machine learning and data science.
